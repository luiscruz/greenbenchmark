## How to run scripts

### Run experiments
1. Connect your ODROID to you computer (other devices also work but you will not be able to collect power data)
1. Create the file ```experiment_stack.csv```. Each line has name of experiment, package name of the app, path to the apk, interaction test data file. E.g.: ```writeily-pro,me.writeily,apks/writeily-pro.apk,writely-pro-view_holder_cache.json```.
The experiment stacks used in the experiments are also available in this repository.
1. ```$ sh run_experiment_stack.sh```

### Generate reports

After having results reports can be generated by running:

```$ python report_all_results.py results_writeily-pro```

### ODROID energy collection script

Collection of power data is made using the shell script ```odroid_energy_monitor.sh```.
It has to be executed by the ODROID device and outputs power data in the file ```/sdcard/energy/energy_log.csv```.
This is automatically handled when running the script ```run_experiment_stack.sh```.

We internally use ADB to automatically upload the script and run it on ODROID.

### Interaction Scripts

Interaction scripts are stored in ```./tests/```.
In order to run you can simply run:

```
$ python acrylicpaint.py
```

Make sure you have your Android device connected to your computer and USB debugging mode activated.
Your app has to be previously installed and running in foreground.

This script generates a cache file (e.g., run_cached_script.json), to optimize further executions.
You can use this cache by running
```
$ python run_cached_script.py tests/run_cached_script.json
```
